# Power BI – Performance Score Analysis Dashboard

This folder contains an interactive Power BI dashboard developed to visualize and compare standardized player performance scores.

## Dashboard Overview

The dashboard fixes Moisés Caicedo as the reference player and allows users to select a single comparison midfielder. Performance is decomposed into multiple dimensions, including creativity, progression, on-ball involvement, and defensive impact.

All scores are standardized such that higher values indicate stronger performance. Percentile indicators reflect a player’s relative standing within the sample of midfielders.

## Purpose

The Power BI dashboard is intended to complement the regression-based residual analysis by providing transparency and interpretability into the construction of performance scores. It serves as a visual benchmarking tool and does not replace the econometric framework used to derive valuation conclusions.

## File Information

- `MGEC45_Score_Dashboard.pbix`: Power BI Desktop file containing all visuals, measures, and interactions.

## Usage Notes

To view the dashboard, open the `.pbix` file using Power BI Desktop. Data sources and methodological details are documented in the accompanying report and data section of the repository.
